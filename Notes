Converting java objects into json object is called serialization. Use jackson library
We can not pass the reference whose object we are creating , we should pass reference of their parent reference for loosely coupled
called as polymorphism

         // response.as(Class<T> clss
        //This method converts (or deserializes) the response body (JSON or XML)
        // into a Java object of the given class type.
       // as() internally uses a deserializer like Jackson
        // or Gson to map JSON fields to Java object fields.
